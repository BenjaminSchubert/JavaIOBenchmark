JAVA IO Benchmarking
====================

This repository contains some performance related experiments with Java base IO modules

This was done for a network class in HEIG-VD in March 2016.


Run the experiment
------------------

If you want to run the experiment, you can just type ``make`` and everything will be run for you and a report
will be made in _build/latex/ .

Note that you will need quite a lot of disk space for this, as more than 20 100 MB files will be created.
